# Caddy Gitea Pages - Test Workflow Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes applied to resolve the failing test workflow.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Corrupted go.mod file**
- **Problem**: The go.mod file had syntax errors and corrupted entries at the end
- **Fix**: Completely rewrote the go.mod file with proper syntax and updated dependencies
- **Changes**: Updated Go version to 1.22, updated Caddy to v2.8.4, updated zap to v1.27.0

### 2. **Missing Test Files**
- **Problem**: The repository had no test files, causing `go test` to have nothing to run
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive unit tests in `giteapages_test.go`
- **Coverage**: Tests for all major functions including CaddyModule, Provision, Validate, UnmarshalCaddyfile, and utility functions

### 3. **Incomplete Implementation**
- **Problem**: The `downloadAndExtractRepo` function had placeholder comments instead of actual implementation
- **Fix**: Implemented complete tar.gz extraction functionality with proper error handling and security checks
- **Features**: Full tar.gz archive extraction, directory creation, file extraction, and path traversal protection

### 4. **Outdated GitHub Actions**
- **Problem**: Using outdated action versions and inefficient caching
- **Fix**: Updated to latest action versions and improved workflow
- **Changes**: 
  - Updated checkout@v4, setup-go@v5, cache@v4
  - Added `go mod tidy` step to ensure dependencies are resolved
  - Improved caching strategy for better performance
  - Added cross-platform build testing

### 5. **Go Version Consistency**
- **Problem**: go.mod specified Go 1.21 but workflow tested against 1.21 and 1.22
- **Fix**: Updated go.mod to use Go 1.22 for consistency
- **Result**: Both go.mod and workflow now consistently use Go 1.22

### 6. **Dependency Issues**
- **Problem**: go.sum was a placeholder and dependencies were outdated
- **Fix**: Cleared go.sum to be regenerated and updated all dependencies to compatible versions
- **Updates**: All golang.org/x/* packages updated to latest compatible versions

## Files Modified

1. **go.mod** - Fixed corruption, updated Go version and dependencies
2. **go.sum** - Cleared for regeneration
3. **.github/workflows/test.yml** - Updated actions, added cross-platform builds, improved caching
4. **giteapages.go** - Implemented complete tar.gz extraction functionality
5. **giteapages_test.go** - Added comprehensive unit tests

## Expected Results

With these fixes, the test workflow should now:
- ✅ Successfully run `go mod tidy` and resolve dependencies
- ✅ Pass all static analysis checks (go vet, staticcheck)
- ✅ Execute unit tests successfully
- ✅ Build the module with xcaddy for multiple platforms
- ✅ Verify the module is properly integrated into Caddy

## Testing Status

The workflow is currently running with the latest fixes. The comprehensive test suite covers:
- Module registration and information
- Configuration provisioning and validation
- Caddyfile parsing and unmarshaling
- Domain mapping and auto-mapping functionality
- Cache management and TTL handling
- Repository name formatting

All tests are designed to be self-contained and not require external dependencies.
